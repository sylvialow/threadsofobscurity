It looks like some kind of flag, but because of the lack of context or knowledge of where the painting is hung, the meaning of the artwork is unknown, and obscure.
Obviously a painting of some sort of fabric, the stripes reminds me of bedsheets. It is painted with a very light and airy feeling, very bright painting. The shadow suggests sunlight coming in from a window above the picture.
Is it like in the theme obsession, because the artist is drawing out curtains, he’s trying to make us figure them out? Or because I am seeing some reflections, am I supposed to look beyond the curtains and into my own reflection?  
It’s a question of the artwork itself- because it's been covered up with cloth, it's as if the artwork is not there if you cover it. But now that you cover it and call it the artwork, then it brings into question if it's still art if covered.

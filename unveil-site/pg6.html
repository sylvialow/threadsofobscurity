            <p class="quote">"The artists could have drawn it as a country flag. The title threads of obscurity suggests different threads representing different people. It could be people of different nations or different beliefs, and they are joined together in one cloth, woven together."

            <p class="quote">"It’s a question of the artwork itself- because it's been covered up with cloth, it's as if the artwork is not there if you cover it. But now that you cover it and call it the artwork, then it brings into question if it's still art if covered."

        <h5 class="animated fadeInLeft" style="animation-delay: 1.4s;">Artists’ Intended Message</h5>
        <div class="info animated fadeInUp" style="margin-bottom: 5vh; animation-delay: 1.6s;">
            <p>“(Un)veil” is about obsession, </br>
                    “Threads of Obscurity” is not. </br></br>
                    
                    The painting shown was chosen at random. It was not intended to show any message, with the only interpretation of the ‘art’ coming from the audience.
                </br></br>
                    The curated experience of the exhibition is our actual artwork, with the painting having a supporting role. With the (un)veil, we wanted to bring across this idea of ‘obsession with art’. 
            </p>

         <video width="220vw" controls style="margin-left: -20vw; margin-bottom: 3vh;">

        </video>
        <p id="vid-text">See how we reproduced the curtain into an 'artwork'</p>
            <div class="info"  style="margin-bottom: 10vh;">
                    <p>
                        It is meant to simulate an curatorial experience that would lead to the audience contributing their thoughts on the ‘painting’. We discovered a range of responses, from in-depth analyses to direct visual descriptions. 
                    </br></br>
                        It brings us to our message that sometimes an artwork is assigned more meaning than what an artist originally intended for it to have, based on one’s own ideals and interpretation of what ‘art’ is.
